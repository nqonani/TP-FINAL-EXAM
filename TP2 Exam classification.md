Employee dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/indronil2489/employee-dataset?resource=download

1. Employee Financial Dataset on Kaggle
Column to Highlight: Salary
Relevance: Salary data directly impacts both the ability and willingness of employees to save. For predicting withdrawals from the accessible pot (First Pot), salary levels provide insights into disposable income and financial flexibility. A higher salary could mean higher savings contributions to the locked pot (Second Pot), while lower salaries may lead to more frequent withdrawals from the accessible pot to cover short-term needs.
Uniqueness: This dataset is primarily financial in nature, focusing on monetary values, which makes it ideal for predicting withdrawal behavior and analyzing salary trends relative to long-term savings.

HR Dataset

2. HR Dataset on Kaggle
Column to Highlight: Satisfaction Level
Relevance: Employee satisfaction can be used for sentiment analysis and to infer the likelihood of withdrawals or retention in a retirement plan. For example, a low satisfaction level may correlate with higher withdrawal rates from the accessible pot, as dissatisfaction could prompt employees to access their savings for personal or financial emergencies. Understanding satisfaction trends is important for forecasting behavioral trends around retirement planning.
Uniqueness: Unlike the Employee Financial Dataset, this dataset focuses on qualitative factors like employee sentiment and engagement, making it uniquely suited for the sentiment analysis part of your project. It provides a human dimension to financial decision-making, giving insights into why employees might act beyond purely financial motives.

Comparison:
Employee Financial Dataset is focused on objective financial data, making it better for precise financial forecasting and withdrawal behavior.
HR Dataset adds value by providing behavioral insights that can be linked to employee financial decisions, especially for sentiment analysis and understanding emotional factors that drive withdrawals or savings decisions.

Data Cleaning and Preprocess as well as Fearure Engineering:

Handling Missing Values
Both datasets contained missing values that needed to be addressed. The strategy employed was:

Numerical columns: Missing values were filled with the column's average value to maintain data consistency.
Categorical columns: Missing values were replaced with the most common (mode) value, ensuring no loss of important categories.
After this step, both datasets had no missing data, ensuring completeness.

Feature Engineering
To prepare the datasets for machine learning, categorical variables were converted to numerical values:

Gender was converted into binary values, with males assigned one and females assigned zero.
Relationship Status was similarly converted, with married individuals assigned one and singles assigned zero.
Additionally, more complex categorical columns with multiple categories, such as job units or departments, were transformed using a technique called one-hot encoding, which creates separate columns for each category.

Data Verification
After feature engineering, all columns were successfully converted into numerical values, making the datasets fully compatible for use in machine learning models. This was the final stage of the preprocessing effort, ensuring the data was clean, structured, and ready for further analysis.

Warning Report: Chained Assignment in Pandas
Overview
During the data preprocessing phase, a warning message was encountered related to chained assignment in Pandas. The warning suggests that the way we are attempting to modify DataFrame columns using the inplace argument will no longer work in future versions of Pandas (from version 3.0 onwards). This issue arises because the operation is performed on an intermediate object, which behaves as a copy, rather than directly on the original DataFrame.

a) Classification (Predicting Withdrawals)

1. Model Accuracy Bar Plot
Interpretation:

The bar plot compares the accuracy of different models for both the employee and HR datasets.
Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. A higher accuracy indicates a better-performing model.

If one model consistently shows higher accuracy across both datasets, it suggests it is more reliable for making predictions about employee behavior or HR benefits. For instance, if Random Forest has an accuracy of 85% for predicting travel behavior, it implies that you can expect this model to correctly predict employee travel decisions 85% of the time.

2. Confusion Matrices
Interpretation:

Confusion matrices visualize the performance of each model, displaying the true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) for each class.

The diagonal values (TP and TN) indicate correctly classified instances, while the off-diagonal values (FP and FN) show misclassifications.

True Positives (TP): Indicates how many employees were correctly predicted to travel. A high TP value suggests the model can effectively identify employees likely to withdraw (in the context of your analysis).
True Negatives (TN): Reflects the number of employees correctly identified as not traveling. This is crucial for understanding retention and stability in employee behavior.
False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN): Analyzing these values helps identify potential issues. For instance, a high FP means many employees are incorrectly identified as likely to travel when they are not, which could lead to unnecessary strategic changes or misallocations of resources.
3. Assessing Predictions in Context
To evaluate how these models answer your specific prediction questions:

For Employee Withdrawals:
A model with high TP (true predictions of withdrawals) is essential. The confusion matrix can help identify if certain demographics or other features (like age, education, etc.) correlate with higher TP, allowing for targeted interventions.
For HR Benefits:
The models can predict which employees might be more responsive to certain benefits packages based on their past behaviors and characteristics. For example, if the Random Forest model indicates that younger employees are likely to respond positively to flexible work options, HR can tailor benefits accordingly.

 Random Forest as the best-performing model due to its superior accuracy and balanced performance metrics compared to other models.

Accuracy: Random Forest typically provides higher accuracy scores, indicating better overall performance in predicting employee withdrawals and engagement.
Minimized False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN): Random Forest often balances the trade-off between FPs and FNs effectively, making it a reliable choice for scenarios where both types of errors can have significant consequences.

b) Forecasting (Long-Term Savings Growth)

Why Use Facebook Prophet?
Time Series Forecasting:

Nature of Data: Both datasets contain time-related information (Time_of_service) and a target variable (growth_rate) that reflects some continuous metric over time. Time series forecasting is suitable for understanding trends, seasonality, and forecasting future values based on historical data.
Handling Seasonal Effects:

Seasonal Patterns: Prophet is specifically designed to handle data with seasonal effects, which may be present in employee growth rates due to factors such as annual reviews, economic conditions, and business cycles. This makes it a good choice for datasets where trends might not be linear.
User-Friendly:

Simplicity: Prophet requires minimal preprocessing and is designed to be user-friendly.

How I Used Facebook Prophet for Both Datasets
Data Preparation:

For both datasets, I aggregated the data on a monthly basis to create a meaningful time series. This involved:
Converting the Time_of_service to a monthly period.
Calculating the average growth_rate for each month to smooth out fluctuations and focus on underlying trends.
Additionally, I took into account factors such as monthly contributions, historical performance, and external economic conditions during the preparation phase to enhance the forecasting model's accuracy. After aggregation, the data was reformatted to fit Prophet's required input structure, with columns named ds (date) and y (target variable).
Fitting the Model:

I created separate Prophet models for the Employee and HR datasets.
Each model was trained on the historical data using the fit() method, which allows Prophet to identify trends and seasonal patterns based on the input data.
Forecasting:

After fitting the models, I generated future forecasts for the next 12 months using the make_future_dataframe() method. This method creates a dataframe containing the dates for which predictions are required.
The predict() method was then used to generate predictions for the growth_rate, providing both point forecasts and uncertainty intervals.
Visualization:

The results were visualized using the built-in plotting capabilities of Prophet. Each plot displayed historical data alongside forecasted values, allowing for a clear visual representation of the trends and the forecasted growth rates. (Visualization representation explained):

X-axis (Time of Service in Years): The horizontal axis represents time, starting from 1970-01 and ending around 1971-01. This suggests the forecast is being made for a one-year period.

Y-axis (Growth Rate): The vertical axis shows the growth rate, and its values seem to be very large, ranging from negative to positive values. The label also suggests the graph is forecasting growth, possibly related to employee data or a similar metric.

The Line: The solid blue line represents the central prediction of the growth rate over time. It starts at zero around January 1970 and trends slightly downward.

The Blue Shaded Area (Uncertainty Interval): This is a 95% confidence interval around the forecast. The farther into the future the model predicts, the wider the interval becomes, indicating greater uncertainty. The shading shows how likely it is that the actual growth rate will fall within the given range. ((Visual representation explained) is true for both dataset.)

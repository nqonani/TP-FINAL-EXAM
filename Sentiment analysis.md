Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. In the context of employee feedback regarding the Two-Pot retirement system.
To apply this analysis, I would first collect qualitative feedback from employees through surveys or open-ended comments. After gathering the data, I would preprocess the text by cleaning itâ€”removing noise such as punctuation, special characters, and stop words, while tokenizing the text into meaningful components. Using either lexicon-based methods, which rely on predefined lists of words associated with specific sentiments, or machine learning approaches trained on labeled datasets, I would classify the feedback accordingly. Positive sentiments would indicate satisfaction or approval of the system, while negative sentiments would reflect dissatisfaction or concerns. Neutral sentiments would encompass factual observations without emotional weight. This categorization would enable me to analyze trends and common themes in employee perceptions, providing valuable insights that can inform management decisions and enhance the Two-Pot system based on employee feedback.
